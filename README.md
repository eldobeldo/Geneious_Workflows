Automated SNP calling 2.0 
==================

Custom automated workflow that works in Geneious R7+

User input: reference sequence and raw sequences for which SNPs are to be identified (raw sequences need to be in sequence list format - right-click, select all sequences, then group into seq list) 

The automated workflow will trim the sequences by quality (HQ < 50 will be removed), map to reference, identify SNPs, export new annotated SNPs and accompanying statistics. Each step will create a sub-folder allowing the user to visually validate the results.

PLEASE note that you will need the Geneious Software to use this workflow.  It is  availble at http://www.geneious.com
